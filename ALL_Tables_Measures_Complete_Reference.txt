================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

❌ Error: "Table not found"
   → Check table name spelling in your model
   → Tables must be named exactly as in script

❌ Error: "Column not found"
   → Verify column exists in source table
   → Check column name case sensitivity

❌ Measure shows BLANK
   → Check filters applied to visual
   → Verify data exists for selected period
   → Ensure table relationships are correct

❌ Percentages > 100%
   → Check for duplicate records
   → Verify denominator is correct base
   → Review filter context

❌ Performance is slow
   → Some measures are complex calculations
   → Consider aggregated tables
   → Use DirectQuery carefully

❌ Numbers don't match expectations
   → Verify source data quality
   → Check filter interactions
   → Test measure in isolation


================================================================================
MEASURE NAMING CONVENTIONS USED
================================================================================

PERCENTAGES & RATES:
   - End with "Percentage" (e.g., FT Student Percentage)
   - Or end with "Rate" (e.g., Participation Rate)
   - Format: 0.0%

COUNTS & TOTALS:
   - Clear descriptive names
   - No special suffix
   - Format: #,0

FINANCIAL:
   - Dollar amounts clearly stated
   - "Revenue", "Budget", "Cost" in name
   - Format: "$"#,0

AVERAGES & MEDIANS:
   - Start with "Average" or "Median"
   - Clear what's being averaged

   - Higher = better (unless noted)
   - Format: 0.0% or 0.0


================================================================================
BEST PRACTICES
================================================================================

✅ DO:
   - Use slicers for time periods
   - Create drill-through pages for details
   - Set up conditional formatting
   - Add reference lines to gauges
   - Document assumptions
   - Test with real data
   - Share with stakeholders for feedback

❌ DON'T:
   - Mix academic years without filters
   - Ignore data quality issues
   - Over-complicate dashboards
   - Use too many measures on one page
   - Forget to refresh after changes
   - Skip user testing
